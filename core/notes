multi-tenant SaaS appointment scheduling system. It covers:

✅ User Roles & Authentication (Admin, Business Owner, Customer)
✅ Business Management (Activation, Blocking, Branding Customization)
✅ Services, Employees, & Availability (Images, Descriptions, Manual & Auto Scheduling)
✅ Appointments (UUID, Cancellation Fees, Payment Options)
✅ Notifications & Reminders
✅ Payments & Transactions
✅ Subscriptions & Billing

A few optimizations to consider:

    QR Code Generation: Best handled in the serializer instead of the model to avoid unnecessary dependencies inside Django models.
    Operational Hours Flexibility: Businesses may need a "break time" within open hours (e.g., lunch break).
    Recurring Payments for Subscriptions: Consider adding fields for automatic renewal & payment tracking.

We'll follow Django REST Framework (DRF) best practices by creating views and routers for the following:

    Authentication & Users:
        Register
        Login
        Verify
        ForgetPassword
        Profile management

        CRUD operations for services

        Analytics 
        Activation/deactivation endpoints

    Employees & Availability:
        CRUD for employees
        Availability management

    Appointments:

        Rescheduling
        Cancellation with fee handling
        Listing appointments for customers & business owners
        Dynamic form for prelimantery question for the customers on the spesific service

    Notifications:
        Retrieve unread notifications
        Mark notifications as read
